        <p id="welcome">Hello and welcome. This is a small project for some but a large undertaking for me. I am planning on adding my wife's and my family recipes in an easy to grab location for cooking and shopping purposes. I will also be adding recipes that we have found on the internet over the years and that we continue to make. This will hopefully make our lives easier when we can't decide what we want to eat until we're at the grocery store and can quickly look up ingredients. It will also be useful when we are traveling with our families and someone wants to make a recipe but they do not have the instructions on them. I hope everyone finds this very useful!</p>
