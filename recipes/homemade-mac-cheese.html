<p>Bonnie's famous Mac and Cheese dish. Spencer asks Sara to make this for him all the time even though he knows she doesn't love to eat it that much. He often will ask her to make it before she leaves for the weekend while he is staying home.</p>

<p>Anyway to the food portion of this description. This mac and cheese puts Kraft to shame. With bits and pieces of Ritz crackers on the top this special meal is delicious. This is best made for anyone, but kids love it especially.</p>
