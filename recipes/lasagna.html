<h1>Lasagna</h1>
<img>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is the Lasagna Spencer grew up eating when he was a child. Perfected by Brandi, it's not an Italian staple, but it is some good ole fashioned American lasagna. Lots of cheese and carby noodles go with this recipe.</p>

<p>It is a good meal to have in the fall in the Midwest when you're not worried about your house getting too warmed up from the oven being on at a high tempature. This is also really good leftover. So make it Friday evening to enjoy on football Saturdays and Sundays!</p>
